### Cplat (Copy Latest)

This CLI tool is made to copy the latest file from the downloads folder to a specified folder. (folders will be ignored)

### Why I built this?

Starting as a small project to learn about how to write code in Rust, I often face conditions where downloading images from UI design tools such as Figma and will have to move the file to where my project is. This tool is made to simplify that step.

### Installation

```shell
# install the CLI tool from crates.io
cargo install cplat

# or install from local after cloning this repo
cargo build
```
